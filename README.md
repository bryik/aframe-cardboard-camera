# A-Frame Cardboard Camera Example

Demonstrates how to display Cardboard Camera photos with A-Frame.

## Use as a Boilerplate

If you want to display your own Cardboard Camera photos, feel free to fork or download this repo and replace the library images with your own.

Instructions:

1) Get vr.jpg source files off your phone and onto your computer.

2) Use [this web service](https://storage.googleapis.com/cardboard-camera-converter/index.html) to convert the vr.jpg to over-under equirectangular.

3) Split the image obtained in step (2) using a tool like ImageMagick. This command works:

```
    magick convert <IMAGE.png> -crop 1x2@ +repage +adjoin pano_%d.png
```

Rename the output images "left" and "right".

4) Download or fork this repository and replace the images in the asset folder with your own.

**What follows is copied from the A-Frame starter boilerplate.**

> :iphone: **Mobile pro tip:** Upon starting the development server, the URL will be logged to the console. Load that URL from a browser on your mobile device. (If your mobile phone and computer are not on the same LAN, consider using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for local development and testing. [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/) is also worth a gander.)

## Publishing your scene

If you don't already know, GitHub offers free and awesome publishing of static sites through __[https://pages.github.com/](GitHub Pages)__.

To publish your scene to your personal GitHub Pages:

    npm run deploy

And, it'll now be live at __http://`your_username`.github.io/__ :)

<hr>

To know which GitHub repo to deploy to, the `deploy` script first looks at the optional [`repository` key](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#repository) in the [`package.json` file](package.json) (see [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#repository) for sample usage). If the `repository` key is missing, the script falls back to using the local git repo's remote origin URL (you can run the local command `git remote -v` to see all your remotes; also, you may refer to the [GitHub docs](https://help.github.com/articles/about-remote-repositories/) for more information).
